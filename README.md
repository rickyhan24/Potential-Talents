# Potential-Talents

In this project, I perform text similarity analysis on a dataset consisting of candidate profile text data to identify the most promising candidates for a specific type of job role.  The resulting model ranks candidates based on similarity to keywords chosen by the recruiter searching for promising candidates.  Secondly, I show how the recruiter can give preference to a given candidate and thereby modify the ranking accordingly so that the ranking system incorporates human feedback.  The ranking system allows for identifying the most relevant candidates for the job and providing a more targeted and efficient hiring process.
